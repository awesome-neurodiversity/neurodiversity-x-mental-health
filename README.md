# Neurodiversity x Mental Health Hub

Before [the Awesome Neurodiversity list](https://linktr.ee/AwesomeND) ever created, I do starting compling and saving different online content about neurodiversity and since late 2022, usually for personal exploration later on and to share with others in the future once I'm fully open about my neurodivergence.

## The Hubs

* [Medium public reading list](https://medium.com/@ajhalili2006/list/neurodiversity-x-mental-health-0668a9b091e5) - Collection of Medium posts from the community, especially TBD.
* [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGqidsjkmgSIXkeghibkLY6d2977P8aMH) - A collection of YouTube videos about all things neurodiversity and mental health, featuring TED(x) Talks from fellow neurodivergent and other disabled people, original content from the community and more.
* [Personal Facebook Saved Collection, currently limited to my friends (on main)](https://www.facebook.com/saved/?list_id=5339273839503232) - Collection of posts from the community with mix of mental health related posts and then some.
